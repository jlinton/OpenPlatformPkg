This is a dump location for prebuild/collected binary images.

The ptable-fedora.img and  HikeyDebugFip.bin should replace the normal ptable
and fip provided by linaro. 

The TIInit_11.8.32.bts and wl18xx-conf.bin will enable Wifi and Bluetooth.
The files should be placed in /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity or wherever you
see the kernel your running complaining about missing firmware files. If the
kernel complains about a different version, you may be able to find it by
googling, but the included versions should work for 4.16+ kernels IIRC.

If installing to SD, the upstream developers haven't fixed the DW->reset
driver dependency. The easy fix during install is when you see:

".
Storing configuration files and kickstarts
..
Installation complete. Press ENTER to quit:

hit esc-tab

then type:
`chroot /mnt/sysimage`
`dracut --add-drivers hi6220-reset -f /boot/initramfs-4.18.xxx.aarch64 4.18.xxx.aarch64 --force`
`exit`
replacing xxx with whatever you find as the kernel version.

then esc-tab back to the "main" window and reboot.
