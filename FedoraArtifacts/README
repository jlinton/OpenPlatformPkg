This is a dump location for prebuild/collected binary images.

The ptable-fedora.img and  HikeyDebugFip.bin should replace the normal ptable
and fip provided by linaro. 

The TIInit_11.8.32.bts and wl18xx-conf.bin will enable Wifi and Bluetooth.
The files should be placed in /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity or wherever you
see the kernel your running complaining about missing firmware files. If the
kernel complains about a different version, you may be able to find it by
googling, but the included versions should work for 4.16+ kernels IIRC.
