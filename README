This repository holds support for UEFI ports for various platforms,
until such a time as a complete solution for platform support in
Tianocore EDK2 is available.

In particular this repo corrects a number of deficiencies in the linaro/hikey
and upstream Openplatform package with respect to the 96boards Hikey. With
those corrections in place the hikey can be used as a normal linux distro
target. In particular fedora/aarch64 can be installed from the standard
install images to a device of the users choosing. Right now the hikey still
requires a serial port for console and UEFI BDS/shell support, but if I feel
motivated I will see about creating a "port" of the linux fbdev driver here
as well. That in theory will allow the machine be be self hosted simply with a
keyboard and monitor as fedora support for aarch64 graphical installs is
functional as of F25. The one serious "gocha" here is the fact that the
original USB2 hikey's host mode cannot seem to form split transactions, or
at least cannot do it the same way that older dwusb controllers form
them (like most ARM SBCs the docs on the hikey are pretty much non-existant,
despite the 96boards attempts to fool everyone by documenting <10% of the
system registers). This means that having a USB2 Ethernet adapter and a USB
keyboard plugged in at the same time simply isn't possible if you want to
maintain performance > 120KB/sec on the Ethernet adapter. 

Anyway, enough complaining. Now some rough instructions:

On a fedora machine:
(install fastboot to flash the device)
dnf install android-tools-5.1.1_r8-6.1.x86_64
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/hikey/linaro/binaries/latest/hisi-idt.py
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/hikey/linaro/binaries/latest/l-loader.bin
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/hikey/linaro/binaries/latest/nvme.img

Put HikeyDebugFip.bin and ptable-fedora.img from the FedoraArtifacts directory
in the directory with the above utilities. Plug a USB cable from the linux
machine to the micro-usb connector on the hikey board (not the seedstudio
serial port board, that should be plugged in else where). Jumper pins 2-3, and
power cycle/reset the board. Now a serial port should appear on the machine. 

(start a fastboot on the hikey)
./hisi-idt.py -d /dev/ttyUSB0 --img1=l-loader.bin
(now flash the ptable and fip.bin to the hikey)
fastboot flash ptable ptable-fedora.img
fastboot flash fastboot HikeyDebugFip.bin
(remove the jumper on pins 2-3)
fastboot reboot
(remove the USB cable from the micro usb, otherwise plugged in devices won't
be recognized)

Plug in a USB DVD with a fedora image burned on it, or dd a fedora ISO image
to a USB flash device and plug that in. Hit reset (or use your favorite method
for picking up new devices). The USB device should show up in the BDS or on
the command prompt (aka 'fs0:' 'cd efi/boot' 'grub.efi'). Run through the
install menu's. Be warned that the emmc shows up as mmcblk0 and if you format it, the
machine will have to be reflashed. 

Other links for similar instructions using debian imaage/etc can be found on
the fedora pages.
